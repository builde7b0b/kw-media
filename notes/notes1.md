Create a wireframe for a portfolio/home website for a youtube comedian and entertainer

Provide a text based wireframe similar to this: TESLA.COM 
As a user scrolls, snap to the next section automatically.
Offer Buttons with calls to actions on every section.

### Youtube Descriptions:
I noticed you did not have many links in your Youtube descriptions.
Your growth is rate is amazing despite this so I would suggest just adding your main website into this description area as a call to action for people to follow up with your services, products and events.

# CURRENT WEBSITE ANALYSIS:

Missing Content:
Videos
I see no reason why the videos pages are missing on this website, with so many videos in your youtube repository and I'm sure you have some on a hard drive that aren't posted. I can have these all categorized by playlist with a search bar so user's can easily find their favorite videos.

Shopify Integration
I can cut cost and save money by getting rid of shopify as the middleman for running your merchandise and save up to 15% by using stripe instead.
Platform Fees: Shopify Charges transaction fees on each sale. Stripe also charges a per transaction fee however it's typically lower than shopify.

Monthly Subscription: If your on a paid shopify plan, transitioning to a custom website can eliminate this fee altogether saving you thousands in the long run. I can manage, maintain and update the website and any additional ones with a pricing model that best suits you and your business as I am flexible and only look to help others and produce quality work.

Customizations and Integrations:
Shopify does offer a bunch of integrations and themes for additional cost however I can provide many additional features such as blockchain integration, AI Integration and Automation as to improve the overall efficiency of the empire that you are building and help you save time and reduce the number of things you have to do.

Merchandise Images
The images and the way they are displayed are a little basic for a modern website and more suitable to something you'd see in the early 2000s. I'd revamp this entire page with slideshows, enhanced option selecting and dynamic images for an overall enhances user experience. The goal is to let user's purchase products as seamless as possible while enjoying the viewing experience throughout so that they want to come back just because it's so visually appealing. 

Book Page - "Help is on the Way"
The book page is great and has a lot of information and relevant links to get to your partners to purchase.
My only suggestions would be to more dynamic and visual appeal such as adding an animation or two, formatting the font below the book to highlight key points and reference longer information. The goal is to get user's the information they need to make a decision and then allow them to make the decision. I would also add some images here and maybe even a storyboard as opposed to just text so enhance the visual appeal and make it pop.

The Tour page is perfect, I wouldn't change anything there at this time. It serves it's purpose.

The Home Page
should feature more media & interviews.
Videos section should be fixed to correctly display feature vieos 


## TESTING
Now as a test, go to your website and just pretend that you were trying to purchase tickets, contact Wayne for something or view some videos for more information.

Take note of how easy and seamless it was to perform these actions.
Did you have any trouble with any pages?
Did everything work correctly?

Now view the website that I made taking note of the same things:
If there is an improvement, please let me know and maybe we can work together to ensure that your web presence and technology aspect of your business and brand remains on-par with current industry standards and also introduces you to new technology to stay ahead of the current trends and continue being an innovator in your relevant industries such as entertainment and comedy.

I appreciate your videos and would love to work with you on a longer-term basis. Websites and applications are just the tip of the iceberg as far as my skillset and I would love to maybe create an mobile app to place in the hands of all of your supporters as well as continue creating applications that serve the purpose of growing your brand.

Best Regards,
Eugene B.
